The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:

    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))
"""
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('blog.urls')),
    path('accounts/',include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),#this give us both models and views for login
    path('accounts/', include('account.urls'))#the order of urls matters cuz django read file top to bottom
    #here when we request accounts/signup first it wil check in auth then in acccounts app.
